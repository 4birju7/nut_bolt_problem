# nut_bolt_problem
We are given a box which contains bolts and nuts. Assume there are n nuts and n bolts and that each nut matches exactly one bolt (and vice versa). By trying to match a bolt and a nut we can see which one is bigger, but we cannot compare two bolts or two nuts directly. Design an efficient algorithm for matching the nuts and bolts.
